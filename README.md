**TODO**

- Dynamic Camera ID Population (required querying server for info)

- Server query for information

- Server query happens at init and after changing camera id (maybe a counter? every 5 seconds?)


**COMMANDS TO IMPLEMENT**
-Camera State

-Set Face Recognition
    *Is it possible to portray faces on buttons? You can set 'face contents' in Edit Recognition command with JPEG base 64 string.
    You can retrieve base 64 string with 'Clip Face Image' command

-Get Face Recognition

-Clip Face Image

-Auto Zoom
